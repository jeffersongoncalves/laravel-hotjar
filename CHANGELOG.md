# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-10-09

- Every `<script>` rendered by the package carries Laravel's Vite CSP nonce when the app sets one (e.g. via laravel-security-headers), so nonce-based `script-src` policies work without `'unsafe-inline'`.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-07

Initial release.
